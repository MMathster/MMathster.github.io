## Independent Mathematician & Analyst

I am an independent mathematician with a BA in Pure Mathematics (Arthur Sard Award, 2014). Since then, I have contributed extensively to the Brilliant.org STEM community (2014 - 2021) and to broader independent mathematics discussion forums.  My specializations include mathematical analysis, geometry and physics.

This site collects selected mathematical notes and expository work.
